2.  Tap START, and you will see this is an oversimplified "spot-the-difference" game. as time goes by, one of the kiwifruits gradually disappears from the bowl. Tap on that disappearing kiwifruit to win the game.

3.  Start the game again, and tap on anywhere other than the kiwifruit to see the "game over" screen. On the game over screen, you are offered to watch a rewarded video ad to get a hint. Tap "Watch an ad and play again with hint" and confirm the rewarded video loads and plays.

4.  Watch the video to completion. After the rewarded video, you can see 50% of the screen is masked, indicating the right answer is not in that part of the image.
