Welcome to the Firebase App on Assistant codelab. In this codelab, you'll learn how to use Firebase, API.AI, and Google Assistant to create an App on Assistant.

### What are you going to build in this codelab?

*   You will build an App on Assistant composed of code and data
*   hosted by Firebase on the backend,
*   conversational logic defined by API.AI,
*   with interactions through a Google Assistant emulator.
*   It will be coded to play a guessing game where the player thinks of an animal, and the app asks a series of yes/no question in an attempt to guess the animal.
*   At the end, if it did not guess the animal correctly, it will ask the player to give it another question to help it guess better in the future.

### What you'll learn

*   Read and write data using the Firebase Realtime Database.
*   Write and deploy server-side code with Cloud Functions for Firebase written in JavaScript.
*   Define the flow of automated conversation with API.AI, and fulfill its requests with an endpoint you provide with Cloud Functions.
*   How to build an App on Assistant for the Google Assistant

### What you'll need

*   Node.js
*   Firebase CLI
