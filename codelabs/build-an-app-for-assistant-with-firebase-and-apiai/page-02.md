### What are Apps for Assistant?

Apps for Assistant are an exciting new way to interact with your users through the Google Assistant. They provide a conversational interface between you and your user, and they are super simple to build with API.AI. You can build all sorts of Assistant apps, from home automation to games and services.

### What is Firebase?

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is a unified mobile development platform that provides tools to help you build, grow and monetize your app. For this codelab, you won't build a mobile app, but you will use two of its features to provide the backend services used to power the app.

[Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/) is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that stores data as JSON. For this codelab, this will provide the data storage needed for the app to store its knowledge.

[Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/features/functions/) lets you run backend code on Google cloud infrastructure that responds to events in your Firebase project. For this codelab, you will create an HTTP endpoint serviced by Cloud Functions that responds to requests from API.AI.

### What is API.AI?

API.AI provides a server-side infrastructure to create conversational scenarios, then build advanced dialogues to manage the conversation flow with the user.

### What is Google Assistant?

At Google, we believe the future is artificial intelligence first. Artificial intelligence, is making computers "smart" so they can think on their own.

We have been investing heavily in the areas of:

*   Machine learning - Teaching computers how to see patterns in data and act on it.
*   Speech recognition and Language understanding - Meaning, being able to understand you when you are talking.

These things come together in the Google Assistant. It allows you to have a conversation with Google.
