# 9. Integrate into Google Assistant

Until now, we've just been using API.AI's built in console for testing. You may have noticed that some things, like the SSML we used in the previous step, come through as raw code. Fortunately, the Google Assistant is able to handle it as you'd expect. This is also your first step into getting this Assistant Apps onto platforms like Google Home.

From the API.AI console in the left navigation menu, select "**Integrations**." Here, you'll be able to select from a wide variety of integrations with other platforms. For this codelab, we'll be looking at the **Actions on Google** integration. Enable that integration now.

Click your project to import. When import is successful, you can leave this page and go back to your API.AI console. Go back to your integration. This time you'll see your default intent selected. Click **AUTHORIZE**.

In the settings form that appears, leave everything as default and click **TEST.**

Once it creates the test, click **View Test.** It will take you to Google Assistant Simulator. Here you can write "**use my test app**" command to trigger the test app.

And now you're ready to test!
