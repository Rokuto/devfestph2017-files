# 10. More chat!

Once you're in the web simulator, try out a full chat again and notice how things like the SSML are actually parsed and how our Assistant App is invoked.

Thanks for taking the time to go through the Firebase Assistant Codelab! If you're interested in designing your own Assistant App, take a look through the Actions on Google documentation at [https://developers.google.com/actions](https://developers.google.com/actions). In particular, check out our best practices within the [Design Walkthrough](https://developers.google.com/actions/design/walkthrough) and the [Design Checklist](https://developers.google.com/actions/design/checklist). And finally, if you think your new agent is ready for the public, we've outlined guidance and the process on [the Distribution page](https://developers.google.com/actions/distribute/).
