# 2. Getting set up

### How does it work?

So how does a conversation action work?

The user needs to invoke your action. You say a phrase like "Ok Google, talk to Animal joke". This tells Google the name of the action to talk to.

From this point onwards, the user is now talking to your conversation action. Your action generates dialog output, which is then spoken to the user. The user then makes requests, your action processes it, and replies back again. The user has a two way dialog until the conversation is finished.

See below, if you like diagrams to â€˜see' what we explained above.

### Login to API.AI

#### So what is API.AI?

API.AI lets the machine understand what the user is trying to say, and can provide the response. You type in example sentences of things that a user might speak.

You can specify what values you need to get from the user. API.AI then uses machine learning to understand the sentences and manage the conversation.
