> This codelab is meant as a sequel of the [**Firebase Web Codelab**](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web) in which you learn how to build a chat app using the Firebase Web SDK. If you would like to learn how to use the Firebase platform on the Web by building a chat app, follow the [**Firebase Web Codelab**](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web) first. If you already know how to use the Firebase platform and CLI and want to learn about the Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions you're at the right place. We'll show you how to clone the completed **Firebase Web Codelab** below.

### What you'll learn

*   Create Google Cloud Functions using the Firebase SDK.
*   Trigger Cloud Functions based on Auth, Cloud Storage and Realtime Database events.
*   Add Firebase Cloud Messaging support to your web app.

### What you'll need

*   The IDE/text editor of your choice such as [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm), [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
