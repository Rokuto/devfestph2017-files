# 2. Get the sample code

Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/firebase/friendlychat) from the command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/firebase/friendlychat
```

> The firebase-codelabs repository contains sample projects for multiple platforms. This codelab only uses these two repositories:
>
> *   ![Directory Icon](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-cloud-functions/img/bb745dc85ae69f6b.png)**cloud-functions-start**—The starting code that you'll build upon in this codelab. Note: This is the same code as the final code for the Firebase Web Codelab.
> *   ![Directory Icon](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-cloud-functions/img/bb745dc85ae69f6b.png)**cloud-functions**—The complete code for the finished sample app.
>
> **Note**: If you would like to run the finished app, you will still have to create a project in the Firebase console. See the **Create a Firebase project and Setup your app** section for instructions.

### Import the starter app

Using your IDE, open or import the ![Directory Icon](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-cloud-functions/img/bb745dc85ae69f6b.png)`cloud-functions-start` directory from the sample code directory. This directory contains the starting code for the codelab which consists of a fully functional Chat Web App.
