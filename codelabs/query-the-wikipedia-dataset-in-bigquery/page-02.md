# 2. Setup and Requirements

### Self-paced environment setup

If you don't already have a Google Account (Gmail or Google Apps), you must [create one](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp). Sign-in to Google Cloud Platform console ([console.cloud.google.com](http://console.cloud.google.com)) and create a new project:

Remember the project ID, a unique name across all Google Cloud projects (the name above has already been taken and will not work for you, sorry!).

Next, you'll need to [enable billing](https://console.developers.google.com/billing) in the Developers Console in order to use Google Cloud resources.

Running through this codelab shouldn't cost you more than a few cents, but it could be more if you decide to use more storage or if you do not delete your objects (see "Delete a bucket" section at the end of this document). Google Cloud Storage pricing is documented [here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#storage-pricing).

New users of Google Cloud Platform are eligible for a [$300 free trial](https://console.developers.google.com/billing/freetrial?hl=en).

### Codelab-at-a-conference setup

The instructor will be sharing with you temporary accounts with existing projects that are already setup so you do not need to worry about enabling billing or any cost associated with running this codelab. Note that all these accounts will be disabled soon after the codelab is over.

Once you have received a temporary username / password to login from the instructor, log into the Google Cloud Console: [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

Here's what you should see once logged in :
