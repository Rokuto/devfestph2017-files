# 4. Create a persona

### Understand the user's situation

In order to design a conversation, we first need to know who's talking - on both sides of the conversation. We need to decide who the character the user is talking to is and a bit about what the user wants to do and what they care about.

Once we understand that, we can create a **persona** that's relevant throughout a conversation that fulfills the user's intent, since we know what their goals and needs are. We will use this knowledge to inform every decision we make throughout the design and prototyping process.

The best way to understand this is to build a journey, considering things like:

What's the user's situation?

What's the user's motivation?

What's the user's expected outcome?

For the purpose of this walkthrough, we will use this example:

*   The situation:
*   Katie is trying the Assistant for the **first time** after purchasing a new phone, while **relaxing at home** in the **evening** she decides to **experiment** with the Google Assistant.
*   The user's motivation:
*   Katie has several motivations. She wants to do something **entertaining**! She also wants to **learn more** about what the Assistant can do for her and how it can help her **interact with other things she uses in her life** with her voice. Katie wants to try something **easy and straightforward**, so decides to try a **science quiz**, because that is her **strongest subject**.
*   The user's expected outcome:
*   Katie is **not entirely sure** what to expect, during the onboarding Katie noticed that the Assistant can play games, so she expects to **start the game**, and be **guided through the process** during the conversation.

### Persona by design

Assistant apps are based on social interaction, so people automatically imagine a person that they are speaking to, this includes gender, age, expertise, character, role and lots of other things. This aspect of the experience is called the **"persona"**.

It's important to establish the characteristics and principles of the persona early in the design process so that the persona can be consistently communicated throughout the entire experience.

Values of a persona:

*   A persona can help set user expectations, such as the **expertise** and **capability** of your action. The more expectation you can set for the user, the more confident they will be to try things, this helps **discoverability**.
*   A persona can help build an emotional connection with users, this will increase loyalty and have an impact on **usage** and **retention**.
*   A **consistent** persona creates **cohesiveness** between multiple actions and between your action and other brand experiences.

### Define your persona's characteristics

Okay, time to roll up our sleeves and get started. First, our persona needs some simple characteristics. To help create relevant characteristics it can be useful to remember the job story.

In this case, the user is **playing a science game**, it's their **first time** talking to an Assistant app, and they are expecting to be **entertained!**

It can also help to identify real-world personas that we can reference, for example Katie's friend Jordan is someone she totally imagines being one of the cast on The Big Bang Theory, so she uses him as our persona inspiration:

Characteristics:

*   Lovably nerdy.
*   Can't let anyone misspeak without correcting them.
*   Fond of long, belabored explanations and speechifying.
*   Dry sense of humor.

We now have a sense of identity for the persona, this is a good time to give the persona a name. In our sample, we've called our character Jordan.
