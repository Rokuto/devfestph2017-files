# 1. Introduction

Ready to create a great Assistant app that people will not only want to use but also love to talk to?

Before diving into code, take a moment to step back and approach your conversation experience from the perspective of:

*   Who's talking?
*   What is it about a character that comes through in the dialog?
*   How will that make a difference for how I build it?

So, human language is complex. This guide walks you through how to design an Assistant app using a Science Quiz as the context to help unravel some of that complexity and take you through the process of creating a persona, designing a multi-step conversation, and tips for how to publish it on [Actions on Google](https://developers.google.com/actions/).
