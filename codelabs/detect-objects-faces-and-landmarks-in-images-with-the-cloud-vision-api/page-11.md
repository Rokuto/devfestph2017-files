# 11. Congratulations!

You've learned how to analyze images with the Vision API. In this example you passed the API the Google Cloud Storage URL of your image. Alternatively, you can pass a base64 encoded string of your image.

### What we've covered

*   Calling the Vision API with curl by passing it the URL of an image in a Cloud Storage bucket
*   Using the Vision API's label, face, and landmark detection methods

### Next Steps

*   Check out the Vision API [tutorials](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/tutorials) in the documentation
*   Find a [Vision API sample](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/cloud-vision) in your favorite language on GitHub
*   Try out the [Speech API](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-speech-intro/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0) and [Natural Language API](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-nl-intro) codelabs!
