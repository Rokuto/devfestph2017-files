# 4. Activate Cloud Shell

Google Cloud Shell is [a command line environment running in the Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/developer-shell/#how_do_i_get_started). This Debian-based virtual machine is loaded with all the development tools you'll need (`gcloud`, `bq`, `git` and others) and offers a persistent 5GB home directory. We'll use Cloud Shell to create our request to the Natural Language API.

To get started with Cloud Shell, Click on the "Activate Google Cloud Shell" <img src="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-nl-intro/img/3b409efdcc18f697.png" alt="Shell Icon" width="25" height="25" class="small"/> icon in top right hand corner of the header bar

A Cloud Shell session opens inside a new frame at the bottom of the console and displays a command-line prompt. Wait until the user@project:~$ prompt appears
