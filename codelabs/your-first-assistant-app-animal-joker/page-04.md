# 4. Test our action

A quick way to test how our new action works on Google home will be to use the web simulator.

We need to click on ‘Integrations' in the left side menu and then click on "Actions on Google".

Click on the ‘TEST' button and you will get this message:

**Test now active**

View on the Actions on Google Web Simulator or any Actions on Google enabled devices you are signed in to

After that, you will need to click on View and the Web Simulator will open in a new tab.

On the left side, you can type (or talk) your commands and on the right side, you can see the responses. Please remember to start with ‘talk to animal joker' so it will know to open our action.

> (!) If after you say: "talk to animal joker," the web simulator tells me the following: "Please turn on Voice & Audio Activity, Web & App Activity, and Device Information permissions for your Google Account." Go to: [https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols?pli=1](https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols?pli=1) and activate it.

We can also test our action with the automated page that API.AI created for our new bot. You need to click on ‘Integrations' page and you will see the image below:

First, you need to click on ‘Web Demo' so this new action will be available to the world. Then, you can customize the url so it will be easier to remember it. In our case, we typed: "animal-joker". You will need to add something in the end of this name, because it must be a unique url.

Now, you can try it.

You will see this screen:

It's very powerful, as you can now share your creation with the world and it will work on any device that is connected to the internet and got a browser.

Good job!
