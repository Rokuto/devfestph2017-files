# 1. Introduction

At Google, we believe the future is artificial intelligence first. Artificial intelligence, is making computers "smart" so they can think on their own.

We have been investing heavily in the areas of:

*   Machine learning - Teaching computers how to see patterns in data and act on it.
*   Speech recognition and Language understanding - Meaning, being able to understand you when you are talking.

These things come together in the Google Assistant. It allows you to have a conversation with Google.

Let's see together how it's all working with a new way for us to hear jokes about animals, cool?

### So what does this mean?

Google Home is a voice activated speaker that users keep in their home.

The Google Assistant is the conversation between the users and Google. They can get things done by talking with the Assistant. There are many things users can do by just using the Assistant directly. To learn more about the assistant check out this short video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPfQMVf4vwQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPfQMVf4vwQ)

Actions on Google allows developers to extend the assistant. A developer can build an app for the Assistant as well, but instead of opening it through your phone, you open it by talking to the Assistant!

That is what we are going to focus on today in our animal joke example.

This codelab will walk you through creating your own Action on Google with API.AI. We are going to use API.AI which is a conversational user experience platform, or in other words, it will help us â€˜talk' to machines in a way they will understand us better.

This codelab will include the design considerations, as well as implementation details, to ensure that your action meets the [key principles](https://developers.google.com/actions/design/principles).

### What you will build

In this codelab, you're going to build an "Animal Joke" action.
Your action will:

*   Utilize and demonstrate the principles of Voice UI.
*   Tell you funny jokes about animals.
*   Provide you with knowledge to create more actions in the future.
*   Ahh! Btw, it won't involve any code!
*   You can test it right now: [https://bot.API.AI/animal-joker](https://bot.api.ai/animal-joker)

### What you'll learn

*   How to design Voice User Interface.
*   How to build an action on google using API.AI
*   How to be funnier in life.

### What you'll need

*   A recent version of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
    Note, this works in other browsers as well.
*   The sample code - [https://github.com/greenido/animal-joker](https://github.com/greenido/animal-joker)
*   A google account (e.g. a gmail address)
